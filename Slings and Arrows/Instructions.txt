Slings and Arrows is a two player competitive game in which both have the objective of eliminating the other. 
This is done by shooting arrows and throwing rocks at the other player untill they run out of health. 
Rocks always move in a straight path when they are fired, but arrows will curve depending on how fast the payer is moving!
